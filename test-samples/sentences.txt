Hey, can you pick up some milk on the way home? Thanks!

Just wanted to let you know the meeting has been moved to three PM tomorrow. Hope that works for you.

I'm running about ten minutes late. Traffic is terrible. See you soon!

Don't forget we have dinner reservations at seven tonight at that Italian place downtown.

Quick reminder: your dentist appointment is next Tuesday at nine thirty in the morning.

The kids need to be picked up from football practice at five. Can you grab them today?

I found that recipe you were looking for. I'll send you the link in a minute.

The package should arrive tomorrow between two and six PM. Make sure someone's home to sign for it.
